##  Multi layered perceptron from scratch with decision boundaries.
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. An MLP consists of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph, with each layer fully connected to the next one. The resulting decision boundary of running backpropagation on the dataset is also added to the notebook.


## Requirements

> **random:** The  [Python module to generate pseudo-random numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)

> **numpy:** The  [fundamental package for scientific computing](https://numpy.org/) with Python.

> **matplotlib:** Comprehensive[ library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations](https://matplotlib.org/) in Python.
